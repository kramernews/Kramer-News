<h1>Serious Stuff</h1>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Sometimes, our reporters are tired of writing award-winning articles.  And sometimes oppressed persons, places, or things need a voice to speak out for them.  Now, here is an outlet for all of those aforementioned dilemas.  So, yes, this page will be filled with dry, boring, stereotypical "let's save the sea turtles!" articles, but at least you're here!
<h2>Foie Gras, Fancy Food or Cockalorem Killer? By DK</h3>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Yummmmâ€¦ Fattened bird pate, drowned in gravy, with enough potent cholesterol to kill a grown man! It's delicious with a rich buttery flavor. It tastes beefy and has a smooth texture that melts in your mouth. People often describe it as having a soft and full flavor when cooked.  Yep, sounds tasty, but keep in the back of your mind, that when you're eating it, it is created through cruel and unusual methods.  Such as, gavage, or force-feeding the poor bird grain with a pipe stuck down its throat.  Often the poor bird will rupture its major organs before it grows old enough to become a meal, but if it does live, then it is brought up in conditions so vulgar, you would be majorly repulsed if you discovered that that you were supposed to eat the bird.  Anyway, a picture says a thousand words, so below is a gross picture.  Oh, what's this?  You aren't sick to your stomach?  Well then, print this picture out and hang it up on your mantel.</p>
