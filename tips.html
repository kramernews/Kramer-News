<h1>Tips For Life</h1>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Have you ever wondered why everyone treats you like a distraught pile of burning tires?  Well, we know why... and so does everyone else.  The evident truth is, you haven't listened to our (or anyone else's) advice.  Sure, maybe you have those little "Life's Little Instruction Book," but let's be honest with yourself: Do you actually heed the advice, or even read it?!!  Well, if you are on a "Tips For Life" webpage of a reputable newspaper, you must not, because Tip #237 of the book reads, "Do not, I repeat, do not EVER go onto a 'Tips For Life' webpage, because you will inevitably get hacked, your insecurities showing."  Anyway, here are some tips, you distraught pile of burning tires!</p1>
<h3 style="text-indent: 40px">Tips For Budding Rappers…</h3>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">1. There is no such thing as a bad song, except for all of ‘dem songs ‘dat ‘dis young‘un generation now listens to.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">2. Remember - if your tattoos don’t cover your face and have your ex girlfriend or boyfriends name on it, then you’ll never make it big time.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">3. Remember there is only one way to Broadway - you take an Uber, not that it matters to budding rappers…</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">4. As I said before, there is no such thing as a bad song, but if you somehow do have a bad song, just set it at 300 beats per minute.  It will sound great then because no one will be able to understand it.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">5. If you are a world famous rapper, and your private jet blows a few tires, don’t make as big a deal out of it as one rapper did...cough...Post Malone...cough.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">6. Also, rappers try not to use cigarettes, and if you do, try not to inhale the smoke...cough...Post Malone..cough</p>
<h3 style="text-indent: 40px">Tips For Traveling...</h3>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">1. Elevators are the most safe mode of transportation, the airlines second.  Still elevators have their risks… I mean, we all know what almost happened to Lois Lane in Superman II in the Eiffel Tower, right?</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">2. “Where is the local tavern?” in French is, “Je suis un touriste stupide, volez-moi s'il vous plaît.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">3. In English, “Where is the hotel?” Can be said in Spanish as, “Soy feo y necesito un baño.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">4. The most easiest way to get to Europe is by just following the road you’re on, ‘cause remember, “All roads lead to Rome.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">5. To be safe from thieving pick-pocketers, take all of you money from your wallet, attach a money band to it, and (preferably) place it in your back right pocket.</p>
