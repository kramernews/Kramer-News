<h1>Tips For Life</h1>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Have you ever wondered why everyone treats you like a distraught pile of burning tires?  Well, we know why... and so does everyone else.  The evident truth is, you haven't listened to our (or anyone else's) advice.  Sure, maybe you have those little "Life's Little Instruction Book," but let's be honest with yourself: Do you actually heed the advice, or even read it?!!  Well, if you are on a "Tips For Life" webpage of a reputable newspaper, you must not, because Tip #237 of the book reads, "Do not, I repeat, do not EVER go onto a 'Tips For Life' webpage, because you will inevitably get hacked, your insecurities showing."  Anyway, here are some tips, you distraught pile of burning tires!</p1>
