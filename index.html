  <h2>Remember When Fidget Spinners Were the Thing?  Here's an Article From Our Archives, Vintage Circa 2017 A.D.</h2>
  <h3>4-28-2017 FIDGET SPINNERS ARE A FAD + A PROBLEM, WHO KNEW? “I DID” SAYS ROBBY THE ROBIN</h3>
<p1>At approximately 0024 on April 28, 2017, Robby the robin said something that chilled each and every one of the obnoxious children... to the bone.  Robby said, “fidget spinners are a fad and a problem.”  For those of you who do not know, a fidget spinner is a small distracting object when used improperly.  Originally created to help with world peace or something they have now become a common object in classrooms all over America that haven’t had the bright idea to ban them.  As is obvious, Robby the Robin was correct.</p1>
<h3>12-22-18 JOHNNY CASH, “PACIFIC RING OF FIRE” NOT AS MUCH OF A HIT AS “RING OF FIRE”</h3>
<p1>     Just as sequels are ne’er as good as the first in a series, just as New York style pizza is best in New York, and just as Garfield can’t compare with Calvin and Hobbes, Johnny Cash’s sequel to “Ring of Fire” bombed big time.  The sequel, expected by meteorologists to be an international success, actually ranked 582nd on the Billboard music ranking thing.  In addition to that, trying to fit an extra three syllables in an already cramped lyric, also led to the premature demise of the song.
     In addition to “the Pacific Ring of Fire,” Cash is also trying to come up with some other songs with which he’ll take back the billboard charts, with.  Those songs include, “A Girl Named Sue” “Hey Concierge” and “Folsom Correctional Facility Blues.”
