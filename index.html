<h3>9-30-2022 GROUND IS BROKEN AS HOMES GO UP ON THE GREAT PACIFIC GARBAGE PATCH</h3>
<p1>  Historic ground was broken on “The Great Pacififc Garbage Patch” on Friday, when the first shovelful of microplastics was lifted and heaved unceremoniously into the nearby ocean, by the nature lover Old Man Frederickson.  Mr. Old Man Frederickson plans to build a nice cozy duplex on the patch (for him and him alone), and will have a cottage in the back to rent to dead albatrosses.
  Mr. Old Man Frederickson commented, “Well, the patch is only going to get bigger.  Say, do you think I could get satellite TV out here?”  When we replied in the negative, he turned on us with a shotgun and threatened, “Git off ma lawn, I, I mean patch, or I-yul shewt!” Needless to say, we left most trepidatiously aboard the H.M.S. Sanguine.</p1>
<h3>9-23-19 HABEUS CORPUS DECLARED!!! “DO THAT MEAN NO MORE SHOOL?” HOPEFUL STUDENTS WONDER...</h3>
<p1>  Yes, yes it does.  When “Habeus Corpus” (A term commonly cited during the Lincoln Year’s) was declared last Thursday, legions of students wondered (often aloud) “Do that mean no more shool?”  Well, to answer the wise students, yes, yes it does.  Roughly translated, “Habeus Corpus” means “No more shool [sic] for ‘dem [sic] smahties!”  Though this translation is often argued against by many distinguished authors, Latin linguists, historians, and viewers like you (thank you), it is altogether fitting and proper that these spreaders of false truths be stopped!!  Immediately!! Through any means!!  For you see, “The Kramer News” has the final say on all things history, for we have a very accomplished gaggle of historians on our team (ain’t that right Mister McCulllough?)  And though this may sound fishy, (a red herring, perhaps?), at least it’s not a conspiracy theory, right?</p1>
<h3>9-22-18 SUMPTIMES I GET TA WONDRIN, WHY CAN’T ALL THE WORLD’S FISH LIVE IN HARMONY?</h3>
<p1>I’m not a very smaht man, but I know sumptings.  I know srimping bidness an stuff like that, anyway, I was srimping one time an I got down to thinking, why can’t awl the world's fish jus live in harmony?  You know, them sharks kill all the guppies an stuff.  Anyway, I decided to act on this information, so I call up my state representative.  He says it seem like a good enough idea, so he gives me a train ticket to Washington.  I got to Washington the next day, an I meet the president, so I asks him my question, an he says it is a mighty fine question, but that it seems hard to solve.  I tells him that it just a trifle, he agrees an give me $20 billion to spend on scientists an stuff.  So I’s goes, an I’s get me some scientists, but they ain’t too smaht, so I’s go an get me my friend Jen-nay Curran.  We’d go together likes pee’s an carrots.  Speaking of pee’s, I got to pee.  Anyways, my frind Jen-nay says that it can’t be solved, an to return the money, so I do’s, an I’m happy, until one day I see’s an itty bitty ant crawlin’ around, that then git etin by a big hairy wasp, so I goes to my representative...</p1>
<h3>8-26-19 NEW EATING UTENSIL; THE SPORF!</h3> 
<p1>Though not recognized by the FDA, (but yet strangely recognized by the NRA), the new Sporf is making ripples in the specialized, multipurpose, underutilized, almost-ne'er-heard-of, eating equipment.  Designed by feral otters, the Sporf is a combination of a fork, knife, spoon, AR-15, and Tyranosaurus Rex bicuspids. Also, the Sporf is a jack of all trades, master of none!  It is also completely and utterly useless.  The Sporf is availible wherever you buy your novelty kitchen equipment, and currently retails at $19.99.  Also, there is currently a counterfeit version made in a third world country drifting around, but it is easily recognized, for it costs $3 less and is of higher quality.  - DK
<h3>6-17-19 AX MURDERERS CAUGHT THEN LOST THEN CAUGHT AGAIN</h3>
<p1>The ax murderers Silent Red and Jimmy the Chopper were caught last 17th like a hungry fish, then lost through a violent coup, like money in a gamblers hand.  Then, like and illness, they were caught, again.  They were quickly imprisoned in Sing-Sing so they could not be lost, like children at Walmart, but caught permanently, like a child on one of those child leashes.</p1>
<h3>6-6-19 AX MURDERERS NOT CAUGHT YET, WATCH OUT!</h3>
<p1> After gruesomely chopping off their victims heads, Silent Red turned to his partner in crime, Jimmy the Chopper and shrugged.  “Should we give the remains to your cannibal friend?” “Nah, let’s burn it!” Jimmy replied.  Now, the only reason I knew this is because I made up this story, but don’t let that bother you.  What really should bother you is the fact that the chances of getting murdered by ax murderers is higher than the chances of getting bitten by a shark or getting killed by a tsunami.  Now that’s scary!</p1>
<h3>6-31-18 U.S.S. UNSINKABLE RECOVERED FROM THE KRAMER POND</h3>
<p1>In a highly unprecedented event that occured a few Saturdays ago, the submarine U.S.S. Unsinkable sank into the dark, dismal, and debilitating waters that call themselves the Kramer pond, and stayed there.  The chief engineer of this project, Davina Schploo, called this atrocity “unprecedented.”  
The submarine itself, a model “47-G5J2” equipped with 1 crew member and a 250 hp engine had been determined seaworthy in a sink a hour before the sinking.  Constructed out of only the finest materials (a chinese food container), and ballasted with four dollars in quarters, it was an expensive venture indeed.  
When the sub was launched it immediately sank to the bottom.  Almost immediately after that, a navy seal diver jumped into the water, quickly retrieving it.  The hatch was opened and the inanimate action figure that was acting as the skipper was found alive, with no water in the sub.  The cause of the uncontrollable sinking was determined to be it sank uncontrollably because there was no way to slow its descent.</p1>
 <h3>6-15-19 TRAVEL TIPS FROM SAN FRANCISCO, COURTESY OF A.W. AND S. W-K.</h3>
   <p1>People [in San Francisco] call gossip "tea" here! Wild.
In less important news, there was a volcanic eruption. Many people were astonished because they never thought that SF would be home to an active volcano. However, many citizens are now happily huddled around the lava flows for warmth, as the San Francisco Summer is as cold as ice and twice as windy.
We encourage visitors to celebrate the rainbow crosswalks in the Castro district. They are the rainbowiest crosswalks this side of the rainbow.
Also we suggest a near-vertical climb up Billygoat Hill, the top of which affords survivors with a glorious panorama of the city, the bay, the east bay, the sky, and parts of outer space.
  <h2>Remember When Fidget Spinners Were the Thing?  Here's an Article From Our Archives, Vintage Circa 2017 A.D.</h2>
  <h3>4-28-2017 FIDGET SPINNERS ARE A FAD + A PROBLEM, WHO KNEW? “I DID” SAYS ROBBY THE ROBIN</h3>
<p1>At approximately 0024 on April 28, 2017, Robby the robin said something that chilled each and every one of the obnoxious children... to the bone.  Robby said, “fidget spinners are a fad and a problem.”  For those of you who do not know, a fidget spinner is a small distracting object when used improperly.  Originally created to help with world peace or something they have now become a common object in classrooms all over America that haven’t had the bright idea to ban them.  As is obvious, Robby the Robin was correct.</p1>
<h3>12-22-18 JOHNNY CASH, “PACIFIC RING OF FIRE” NOT AS MUCH OF A HIT AS “RING OF FIRE”</h3>
<p1 style="text-indent: 40px">     Just as sequels are ne’er as good as the first in a series, just as New York style pizza is best in New York, and just as Garfield can’t compare with Calvin and Hobbes, Johnny Cash’s sequel to “Ring of Fire” bombed big time.  The sequel, expected by meteorologists to be an international success, actually ranked 582nd on the Billboard music ranking thingy.  In addition to that, trying to fit an extra three syllables in an already cramped lyric, also led to the premature demise of the song.
</p1>   In addition to “the Pacific Ring of Fire,” Cash is also trying to come up with some other songs with which he’ll take back the billboard charts, with.  Those songs include, “A Girl Named Sue” “Hey Concierge” and “Folsom Correctional Facility Blues.”
