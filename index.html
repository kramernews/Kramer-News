<h3>8-26-19 NEW EATING UTENSIL; THE SPORF!</h3> 
<p1>Though not recognized by the FDA, (but yet strangely recognized by the NRA), the new Sporf is making ripples in the specialized, multipurpose, underutilized, almost-ne'er-heard-of, eating equipment.  Designed by feral otters, the Sporf is a combination of a fork, knife, spoon, AR-15, and Tyranosaurus Rex bicuspids. Also, the Sporf is a jack of all trades, master of none!  It is also completely and utterly useless.  The Sporf is availible wherever you buy your novelty kitchen equipment, and currently retails at $19.99.  Also, there is currently a counterfeit version made in a third world country drifting around, but it is easily recognized, for it costs $3 less and is of higher quality.  - DK
<h3>6-17-19 AX MURDERERS CAUGHT THEN LOST THEN CAUGHT AGAIN</h3>
<p1>The ax murderers Silent Red and Jimmy the Chopper were caught last 17th like a hungry fish, then lost through a violent coup, like money in a gamblers hand.  Then, like and illness, they were caught, again.  They were quickly imprisoned in Sing-Sing so they could not be lost, like children at Walmart, but caught permanently, like a child on one of those child leashes.</p1>
<h3>6-6-19 AX MURDERERS NOT CAUGHT YET, WATCH OUT!</h3>
<p1> After gruesomely chopping off their victims heads, Silent Red turned to his partner in crime, Jimmy the Chopper and shrugged.  “Should we give the remains to your cannibal friend?” “Nah, let’s burn it!” Jimmy replied.  Now, the only reason I knew this is because I made up this story, but don’t let that bother you.  What really should bother you is the fact that the chances of getting murdered by ax murderers is higher than the chances of getting bitten by a shark or getting killed by a tsunami.  Now that’s scary!</p1>
<h3>6-31-18 U.S.S. UNSINKABLE RECOVERED FROM THE KRAMER POND</h3>
<p1>In a highly unprecedented event that occured a few Saturdays ago, the submarine U.S.S. Unsinkable sank into the dark, dismal, and debilitating waters that call themselves the Kramer pond, and stayed there.  The chief engineer of this project, Davina Schploo, called this atrocity “unprecedented.”  
The submarine itself, a model “47-G5J2” equipped with 1 crew member and a 250 hp engine had been determined seaworthy in a sink a hour before the sinking.  Constructed out of only the finest materials (a chinese food container), and ballasted with four dollars in quarters, it was an expensive venture indeed.  
When the sub was launched it immediately sank to the bottom.  Almost immediately after that, a navy seal diver jumped into the water, quickly retrieving it.  The hatch was opened and the inanimate action figure that was acting as the skipper was found alive, with no water in the sub.  The cause of the uncontrollable sinking was determined to be it sank uncontrollably because there was no way to slow its descent.</p1>
 <h3>6-15-19 TRAVEL TIPS FROM SAN FRANCISCO, COURTESY OF A.W. AND S. W-K.</h3>
   <p1>People [in San Francisco] call gossip "tea" here! Wild.
In less important news, there was a volcanic eruption. Many people were astonished because they never thought that SF would be home to an active volcano. However, many citizens are now happily huddled around the lava flows for warmth, as the San Francisco Summer is as cold as ice and twice as windy.
We encourage visitors to celebrate the rainbow crosswalks in the Castro district. They are the rainbowiest crosswalks this side of the rainbow.
Also we suggest a near-vertical climb up Billygoat Hill, the top of which affords survivors with a glorious panorama of the city, the bay, the east bay, the sky, and parts of outer space.
  <h2>Remember When Fidget Spinners Were the Thing?  Here's an Article From Our Archives, Vintage Circa 2017 A.D.</h2>
  <h3>4-28-2017 FIDGET SPINNERS ARE A FAD + A PROBLEM, WHO KNEW? “I DID” SAYS ROBBY THE ROBIN</h3>
<p1>At approximately 0024 on April 28, 2017, Robby the robin said something that chilled each and every one of the obnoxious children... to the bone.  Robby said, “fidget spinners are a fad and a problem.”  For those of you who do not know, a fidget spinner is a small distracting object when used improperly.  Originally created to help with world peace or something they have now become a common object in classrooms all over America that haven’t had the bright idea to ban them.  As is obvious, Robby the Robin was correct.</p1>
<h3>12-22-18 JOHNNY CASH, “PACIFIC RING OF FIRE” NOT AS MUCH OF A HIT AS “RING OF FIRE”</h3>
<p1 style="text-indent: 40px">     Just as sequels are ne’er as good as the first in a series, just as New York style pizza is best in New York, and just as Garfield can’t compare with Calvin and Hobbes, Johnny Cash’s sequel to “Ring of Fire” bombed big time.  The sequel, expected by meteorologists to be an international success, actually ranked 582nd on the Billboard music ranking thingy.  In addition to that, trying to fit an extra three syllables in an already cramped lyric, also led to the premature demise of the song.
</p1>   In addition to “the Pacific Ring of Fire,” Cash is also trying to come up with some other songs with which he’ll take back the billboard charts, with.  Those songs include, “A Girl Named Sue” “Hey Concierge” and “Folsom Correctional Facility Blues.”
