<h1>Well, Hello Internet Extraordinaire!</h1>
<h3>You are right now in the secretive portion of "The Kramer News."</h3>
<p1>No one knows about this except you, myself, and Emerey, a (gender neutral) high profile reporter. (S)He reports level 13.007 secret articles that are so condeming, they are only published here, where most people do not find them.  (S)He will however publically leak a level 1.1123581321 secret article on the main page, soon.  Ha, that main page article is completely bologna, a red herring, if you will.  Well, I'm hungry, so I'll go eat some fish.  Remember though, all secret information will be found here!!! </p1>
