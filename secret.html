<h1>Well Hello Internet Extraordinaire.</h1>
<h3>You are right now in the secretive portion of "The Kramer News."</h3>
<p1>No one knows about this except you, and Emery, our (Gender Neutral) high profile reporter. (S)He reports level 13 secret articles that are so condeming, they are only published here, where most people do not find them.  (S)He will however publically leak a level 2 secret article on the main page, relatively soon.  Ha, that article is completely bologna, a red herring, if you will.  Well, I'm hungry, so ill go eat some fish.  Remember though, all secret information goes here!!! </p1>
