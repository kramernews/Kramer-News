Or maybe you want to compliment us on our excellent, grade A work.  Or maybe, you would like to request a print version for a friend.  Well, it's very simple, all you have to do is send an email to TheKramerNews@gmail.com.  You should also include in the subject line, why you're sending us an email so we can better assist you.  Should you want to contribute, we have several requirements:</p1>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">1. No expletives.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">2. Nothing political.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">3. It has to be funny.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">4. If it's a gross article, we'll just ignore you.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">5. Don't send us spam, Nigerian princesses and internet creeps.</p>
