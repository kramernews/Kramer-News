<h3>Harry Potter, a Symposium</h3>
<p1>In my opinion, Harry Potter is one of the best series in the world. It has a mix of adventure, comedy, and romance. Ooh-la-la! The battles between Harry's allies and the Death Eaters will thrill your heart. At certain points, when the wizards battle, the good guy's magic color is red, which is a refreshing break from the trope where red represents evil, as is exemplified by Star Wars, GI Joe, Avatar, and Clifford, the Big Red Dog.<p1>
